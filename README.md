# LabCorp Clinical Development UI Developer Assessment

## Thank you for your interest in working with us at LabCorp!

This project is a fork of [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com/)

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to download this repo and make the app functionally equivalent to: [http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/](http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/).

Please **do not fork this repo** as your code will not be accepted from a fork.

The previous developer left the project half-finshed, but quite a bit of infrastructure is in place and we'd like to see how you would finish it out.

- All of the styling for the app is complete and almost all of the HTML markup you'll need is present in the [app.component.html](https://github.com/labcorp-clinical-development/coding-assessment/blob/master/src/app/app.component.html) file.
- In order to complete this project, you're going to have to have knowledge of [Angular](https://angular.io), [Ngrx](https://ngrx.io/), [Rxjs](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/), inter-component communication and how to make components re-usable.
- You may **not** use Ngrx/Data or Ngrx/Entities to complete this project.
- It isn't necessary to write end-to-end tests for your work, but if you choose to write unit tests for your reducer or components, it would be a big plus.
- Your code *must* pass AOT compilation when running: `ng build`
- Neatness and organization count - **a lot**.

You'll find all of the code for todos in the [src/app/todos](https://github.com/labcorp-clinical-development/coding-assessment/tree/master/src/app/todos) module.

## Notes:

### Order of todos

Todo MVC puts the newest todo at the end of the list; this seems wrong. Please add new todo items at the beginning of the list.

### Editing a todo

When editing a todo, you'll need to modify your form's HTML input class attribute to "edit". To make the form visible, it must come after the `div` classed "view" in the markup here: [todo-list.component.html](https://github.com/labcorp-clinical-development/coding-assessment/blob/master/src/app/todos/components/todo-list/todo-list.component.html)

### Message when no todos are present

Please add a message to be displayed when filtering by "Active" or "Completed" and no todos are present. A CSS class is available to use for your element, `no-matches`

### What else should I be aware of?

LabCorp Clinical Development projects are some of the most challenging you'll find in the entire organization. As such, the margin for error and leeway on certain aspects of the code you provide is very thin, so be careful and measured in your approach.

### Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.7
